# WordToSQL App Using OpenAI's text-davinci-003 LLM

Welcome to the WordToSQL App repository! This application leverages OpenAI's powerful text-davinci-003 language model to convert natural language prompts into SQL statements. With this tool, you can easily translate your verbal instructions or queries into structured SQL commands.

## How It Works

1. **Input Prompt**: Enter a natural language prompt describing the SQL operation you want to perform.

2. **OpenAI's text-davinci-003**: The application utilizes OpenAI's state-of-the-art language model to understand and interpret your input.

3. **SQL Output**: Receive a generated SQL statement as output, reflecting the desired database operation.
